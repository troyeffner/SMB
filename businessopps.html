        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Sales promises things operations can't deliver</li>

        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Orders that sit waiting for approval for days</li>
            <li>Customer requests that bounce between three different people</li>

            <li>Information gets lost when sales hands off to delivery</li>
            <li>Customer requests fall through the cracks between departments</li>

        <div class="prompt">Tell me about a workaround your team has created - something they do differently than the "official" way because the official way doesn't work.</div>
        <div class="examples-header">For example:</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Keeping separate spreadsheets because the software doesn't do what you need</li>
            <li>Informal phone calls to get things done faster than the official process</li>
            <li>Skipping steps that slow things down but don't add value</li>

            <li>The owner used to handle everything, now things slip through the cracks</li>
            <li>Everyone used to just know what to do, now new people are lost</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="category-card">
        <div class="category-title">Technology & System Integration</div>
        <div class="prompt">Tell me about software or systems you're using that don't talk to each other the way you need them to, or that create more work than they save.</div>
        <div class="examples-header">For example:</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Entering the same information in three different places</li>
            <li>Data that doesn't sync between systems</li>
            <li>New software that nobody actually uses because it's too complicated</li>

            <li>Everything feels urgent, nothing gets finished</li>
            <li>Not sure if you should invest in people, processes, or technology</li>
            <li>Different stakeholders pushing for different priorities</li>
            <li>Knowing something needs to change but not knowing where to start</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="category-title">Customer or Quality Issues</div>
        <div class="prompt">Describe a recurring complaint or quality problem where you're not sure if it's a training issue, a process issue, or something else.</div>
        <div class="examples-header">For example:</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Customers complaining about the same thing over and over</li>
            <li>Quality inconsistencies depending on who does the work</li>
            <li>Mistakes that happen even though people know better</li>

    <div class="category-card">
        <div class="category-title">New Hire Onboarding</div>
        <div class="prompt">Tell me about what happens when someone new joins - what do they struggle to learn, and what takes longer than it should for them to be productive?</div>
        <div class="examples-header">For example:</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>New people asking the same questions because nothing's written down</li>
            <li>Taking months to learn things that should take weeks</li>
            <li>Heavy reliance on one person to train everyone</li>
            <li>New hires not knowing who to ask for what</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="category-card">
        <div class="category-title">Unclear Roles & Responsibilities</div>
        <div class="prompt">Describe a situation where it's not clear who's supposed to do something, or where multiple people think they're in charge of the same thing.</div>
        <div class="examples-header">For example:</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Tasks falling through the cracks because everyone assumes someone else will do it</li>
            <li>Duplicate work because people don't know others are handling it</li>
            <li>Conflicts over who has decision-making authority</li>
